**Project structure:**

The code folder contains our implementations of data processing and model training/evaluation. Our project is split into muliple Jupyter notebooks, which contain code and Markdown comments. The names of the files indicate what they build.

Our dataset is not contained in this repository due to its large size. It is described within our CS229 report. 

The references folder contains some of the papers that we reference within our report.
